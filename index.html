                              <h2>FEATURE: Professor, Teach Thyself</h2>
                              
                              <p>I am a web developer. Previously,  I worked as an English as a Second Language adjunct instructor for over ten years. 
                                It started out great with a one-year stint in Tokyo, Japan, teaching at a language school. It turned from a fun way to 
                                travel abroad into a career when I returned stateside with surprisingly few job opportunities being presented to me as
                                 an English Literature major.</p>
                               <p> I decided to debug my life (hold on tight, more cheesy jokes to follow!) and learn web development. I needed to get
                                  excited about learning again, and web development seemed like the creative outlet I needed.</p>
                                <p> Coding requires learning languages. I taught language, and speak anime-centric Japanese, So I should take to coding 
                                  like the proverbial duck to water, right? RIGHT?!? </p>
                              

                                <h3>Functions and Loops and Arrays, Oh My!</h3>
                                      
                              <p>Well, not quite.</p>
                              <p>I think my experience has made me open to the idea of not knowing things, and being comfortable 
                                with that as an adult. But it has not alleviated the anxiety I feel when I don't get something on
                                 the first go. Or second, or third (I'm talking about you, JavaScript Currying!)</p>

                                 <p>Learning is, of course, it's own reward, but sometimes it is hard to appreciate that when you 
                                   want to be rewarded with some divs being creatively aligned on a page like comic book panels. Or a cookie. 
                                   Which you feel guilty about having if they aren't served on a plate of functioning, beautiful code.</p>

                              <p>Well, 97 of them. I also have tennis elbow from a quite physically-demanding retail job 
                                that is just barely paying the bills until I get a developer gig, and a vitamin B12 deficiency 
                                after switching to a plant-based lifestyle. But those 97...they keep me up at night. Perhaps it is the 
                                old "girls are to math/technology as oil is to water" myth, or just not having the opportunity to sit down and learn
                                 something new from scratch in quite some time, but I feel both terrified and guilty for committing 
                                 myself to this pursuit. While I love every snippet of code I write (the act of coding, not necessarily
                                the output...yet), I sometimes think it is an exercise in failure, that I will never be able to create a
                                beautiful CodePen animation purely out of CSS, or work on a team to build an exciting landing page for an innovative 
                                start-up. And if this is the case...wouldn't I be better served to devote my study time to my family? Pick up another 
                                teaching gig because, hey, I already have a Masters in that field. Plenty of people earn money from unfulfilling 
                                careers. Why should I be any different?</p>

                              <p>It's always daunting to switch gears and learn something new (elderly canine comparisons do NOT help). 
                                But it's important to have a clear understanding of what you would like to accomplish, the skills that 
                                are required for that position/goal, and a solid awareness of your gaps in understanding.

                                    they are there at your fingertips.Keep trudging forward in your search for the perfect way to render
