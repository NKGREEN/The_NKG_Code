                              <p>I am a web developer. Previously,  I worked as an English as a Second Language adjunct instructor for over ten years. It started out great with a one-year stint in Tokyo, Japan, teaching at a language school. It turned from a fun way to travel abroad into a career when I returned stateside with suprisingly few job opportunities being presented to me as an English Literature major.</p>
                               <p> I decided to debug my life (hold on tight, more cheesy jokes to follow!), take the red pill, and learn web development. I needed to get excited about learing again, and web development seemed like the creative outlet I needed.</p>
                                <p> Coding requires learning languages. I taught language, and speak anime-centric Japanese, So I should take to coding like the proverbial duck to water, right? RIGHT?!? </p>

                              <p>It's always daunting to switch gears and learn something new (elderly canine comparisons do NOT help). But it's important to have a clear understanding of what you would like to accomplish, the skills that are required for that position/goal, and a solid awareness of your gaps in understanding.
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Learn the art of "Google-Fu"! You can't expect the answers to just be given to you, but know that they are there at your fingertips.Keep trudging forward in your search for the perfect way to render inline elements, no matter how many rude comments your question gets on Stack Overflow.</li> 
                                    <li>Find a group of like-minded individuals, who can relate to your challenges. I've found that in my Moms Can & Co cohort. ü•∞</li>
